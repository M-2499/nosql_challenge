# nosql_challenge


This repository contains the solution to the NoSQL challenge provided by Eat Safe, Love, a food magazine. The challenge involves working with a dataset provided by the UK Food Standards Agency, which evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and assigns them a food hygiene rating.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up- NOSQL_setup_starter.ipynb**
   - In this section, the data is imported into a MongoDB database named `uk_food` with a collection named `establishments`. The provided Jupyter notebook `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb` contains the code and steps for this setup.

2. **Part 2: Update the Database**
   - This section involves making modifications to the `establishments` collection in the database. The specific tasks include adding a new restaurant, updating its details, and performing some data conversions. The code and instructions are provided in the same Jupyter notebook `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`.

3. **Part 3: Exploratory Analysis**
   - In this section, exploratory analysis is performed on the dataset to answer specific questions provided by Eat Safe, Love. The questions revolve around hygiene scores, ratings, and establishment details. The Jupyter notebook `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb` contains the code and steps for this analysis.

## How to Use

Follow the steps below to replicate the analysis:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Set Up the Database**
   - Open and run the Jupyter notebook `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb` for Part 1. This will set up the MongoDB database and import the data.

3. **Update the Database**
   - Continue in the same notebook (`NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`) for Part 2. Follow the instructions to make the necessary modifications to the database.

4. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Open and run the Jupyter notebook `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb` for Part 3. Follow the provided questions to explore the dataset.

5. **Review and Analyze**
   - Review the analysis, results, and visualizations provided in the Jupyter notebooks. Feel free to make further observations or insights.

## Files

The repository contains the following key files:

- `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Part 1 and Part 2 of the challenge, including database setup and updates.
- `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Part 3 of the challenge, involving exploratory analysis.
- `Resources/establishments.json`: The dataset provided by the UK Food Standards Agency.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine before starting the analysis.
- Make sure to install the required Python libraries mentioned in the Jupyter notebooks.
